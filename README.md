This final project of the class, we were asked to create a program that allowed the user to search items, display the frequecy they're pruchased at, and print a histogram showing all the data. 

I wrote the functions very well. Apart from a couple issues with infinite looping, I di not hav to make too many tweaks to make it work how I wanted. 

The program and code would be better if the data could be modified from within the program itself. Currently, the data is all preloaded through a text file. Addin in functionality to add items or update values would make the program more efficient to use and more adaptable to a changing inventory and newer data. 

I had trouble figuring out a way to effetively store and retrive data. After reading a few threads on Stackoverflow, it appeared that using a map would be the easiest way.

This project utlized several skills that will be transferrable: building and using linked-lists, creating functions and then implenting them in main, and input verification. 

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by utilizing functions to split the different functions of the program outside of main. This will make it easy to either add more or modify the exiting ones. The functions are easy to read as they're in their own sections as well.
